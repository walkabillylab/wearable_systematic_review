## Abstract
Introduction: Consumer-wearable activity trackers are small electronic devices engineered to monitor and record fitness and health-related measures. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the validity and reliability of commercial wearables in measuring step count, heart rate, and energy expenditure. 

Method: We extracted information about commercial wearable devices (e.g., price, size, battery life, sensors, measurements, algorithms) using an Internet search conducted from November 2016- January 2017. From this search we identified devices to be included in the review. Database searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and SPORTDiscus, and only included articles published in the English language up to May 2019. Studies were excluded if they did not identify the device used and if they did not examine the validity and/or reliability of a device. Studies including the general population and all special populations were included. We operationalized validity as criterion (as compared to other measures) and construct (degree to which device is measuring what it purports) validity. Reliability measures focused on intradevice and interdevice reliability. 

Results: We included 158 publications examining 9 different commercial wearable device brands. Fitbit was by far the most studied brand. In lab-based settings Fitbit, Apple, and Samsung appeared to measure steps accurately. Heart rate was more variable with Apple Watch, Garmin was the most accurate and Fitbit tended towards underestimation. For energy expenditure, no brand was accurate. We also examined validity between devices within a specific brand.

Conclusion: Activity trackers are still an emerging market and the devices are constantly being upgraded and redesigned to new models, suggesting the need for more current reviews and research.
